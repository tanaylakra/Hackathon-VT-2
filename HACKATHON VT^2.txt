Intro: We are the students of Integrated B.tech-M.tech CSE (2nd year- 3rd sem) from School of ICT
       and our topic is marking attendance using face detection.

1.Here in this project our main aim was to create an attendence sheet based on face recognition system, we have performed all the steps from data collection
  to the final outout which means marking attendence and the corresponding timeline in a csv file (attendence.csv) after the face detection of a person.

2.We have mainly used three modules to make this project : Face recognition module (for face detection), datetime module (for taking the attendence) & 
  opencv module (for marking the face which is detected).

3.We have tried to take the attendence of 4 persons in this project: Hrithik Roshan, Ratan Tata, Chanda Devi and Krish Naik

4.Rest of the things you can find in our code, we have used the best of my knowledge to explain everything there.
